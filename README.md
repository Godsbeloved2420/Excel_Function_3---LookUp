Excel_Function_Analysis using LookUp Function

## 2.0 Introduction

### 2.1. Objectives: 

The aim of the analysis were to look-up the different salary compensation schedule for the different grade levels from a salary structure chart.

### 2.2. Context:

The dataset is made up two datasets: the organizational Database which is the Salary Compensation Schedule as at 1st January 2020 and the Simple Salary Structure. The Database is made up of: seriel number, employee number, employee names, departments, grade level. Other columns like: 
Basic, housing, transport, meal, leave, utility and gross pay was look-up from the Simple Salary Structure sheet using VLOOKUP function. The Simple Salary Structure chart which represent the simple salary scale per level have columns like: Level, Basic, housing, transport, meal, leave, utility and gross. This sheet served as the look-up array.

### 2.3. Data Sources

The primary source of data used here is Excel_Function 3-LookUp.xlsx which was gotten as an excel file and was supplied by the facilitator.

## 3.0. Data Understanding

### 3.1. Data description
The dataset was gotten in a structured form. The Database sheet has 85 observations and 5 fields while the Simple Salary structure sheet contains 9 observations and 8 fields.

### 3.2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Microsoft Excel was implored in analyzing the dataset. At the end of the analysis, we were able to look-up the basic, housing, transport, meal, leave, utility and gross salary from the simple salary structure chart into the database using VLOOKUP function.

## 4.0. Methodology

### 5.2. Interpretation/key findings: 

From the result, it can be seen:

•	The male customers earned more than the females and therefore purchased more bike than the females.

•	the company had more patronise from customers who travel 0-1 miles compared to others. The lowest patronise came from that travelled distances more than 10 miles.

•	the middle-aged customers purchased bike the most compared to the adolescents and the old customers.

•
